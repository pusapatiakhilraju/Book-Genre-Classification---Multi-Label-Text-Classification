# Book-Genre-Classification---Multi-Label-Text-Classification
this tutorial, I will show you how to predict Genres from the description of a books.  We will build a multi-label model thatâ€™s capable of detecting different types of genre for each summary. We tune the hyper-parameters and plot graphs to find the best linear model. 

Steps :
1) Read Data
2) Data Pre-Processing
3) Visualize the Data
4) Data Transformation
5) Training Classifier
6) Calculate Accuracy
8) Tune HyperParameters
9) Finalize the Best Model
